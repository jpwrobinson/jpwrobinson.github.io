      <description>Repost of this article in The Conservation
Tropical island states enjoy global demand for their seafood, but many have growing populations and hungry tourists to feed. Their fisheries are often unregulated and lack dSeychelles and Palau
People in the Seychelles eat more seafood than any other country in Africa, averaging 60kg per person per year. But as many seafood species, including bourzwa, have become valuable exports, their prices have jumped, making some popular fish unaffordable for many locals.</description>

      <description>This is my Plain Language Summary posted on Functional Ecology
Coral reefs support high numbers of fishes which feed on plant material – these reef herbivores include surgeonfish which act as lawnmowers to ‘crop’ turf algae and parrotfish with powerful beaked jaws which ‘scrape’ algae and dirt from the reef.
Experiments have shown that cropping and scraping are key ecological functions on coral reefs, helping to maintain reefs in coral-dominated states, particularly after events such as coral bleaching which kill corals and allow fast-growing turf algae and seaweeds to take over.</description>

      <description>This is my Behind the Paper blog posted on Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution
How long-term datasets and an international collaboration uncovered climate impacts
A marine heatwave that turned coral reefs into seaweed fields has made reef fisheries less predictable and more productive, impacting small-scale fishers over 20 years later. In our new paper, we document how a mass coral bleaching changed the composition of fish communities, and how this led an increase in the amount of fish caught by artisanal fishers.</description>

      <title>Fishing degrades reef fish size structure</title>

      <description>From spears to gillnets and artisanal fishers to commercial boats, coral reef ecosystems are exploited across a range of fishing pressures and with diverse gear types. Reefs are valuable food resources for tropical coastal communities and yet our understanding of fishing impacts on reefs is often founded on studies that measure how much fish biomass is depleted in fished areas. In order to understand broader impacts on aspects of community structure we quantified reef fish size structure - the fish size distribution, or relative abundance of different body sizes - at major Pacific island groups that span gradients in human presence and environmental influences.</description>

      <title>Fitting size spectra to empirical data</title>

      <description>The size spectrum describes the distribution of body sizes within a community, and is widely used among fisheries biologists to track exploitation effects and parameterise theoretical size-based ecosystem models. Most notably, empirical size spectrum estimates have provided insights into community-level changes in overfished ecosystems. In a project led by Dr. Andrew Edwards (Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada) and recently published in Methods in Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution, we show that empirical size-spectrum fitting methods are not standardised and many are biased.</description>

      <title>Predator-prey mass ratios</title>
      <link>https://jpwrobinson.github.io/post/ppmr/</link>

      <description>Predator-prey mass ratios (PPMRs) reflect the strength of interactions between predators and prey, and can be used to examine community size structure. PPMRs can be estimated using diet data (e.g. Barnes et al. 2010, Ecology) or with stable isotope methods in which an individual&amp;rsquo;s trophic position is inferred by measuring the fractionation of nitrogen 15-N relative to a baseline value.
Although standard &amp;lsquo;additive&amp;rsquo; approaches assume that 15-N fractionates by 3.4‰, Hussey et al.</description>

      <title>Size structure of coral reef fish communities</title>

      <description>Despite a strong focus on understanding patterns in the diversity, behaviour and functional roles of fish on coral reefs, we know far less about how fish communities are structured. In most aquatic communities, gape limitation and ontogenetic niche shifts produce communities that are size structured, where predators are larger than their prey. Our expectation is that reef fish communities should also be size structured, though this has not been formally tested.</description>
