      <description>\1. Herbivory is a key process on coral reefs which, through grazing of algae, can help sustain coral-dominated states on frequently-disturbed reefs and reverse macroalgal regime shifts on degraded ones.
\2. Our understanding of herbivory on reefs is largely founded on feeding observations at small spatial scales, yet the biomass and structure of herbivore populations is more closely linked to processes which can be highly variable across large areas, such as benthic habitat turnover and fishing pressure.</description>

      <title>Abiotic and biotic controls on coral recovery 16 years after mass
bleaching</title>

      <description>As climate changes increase heat stress on tropical ecosystems, the long-term persistence of coral reefs requires rapid coral recovery following coral bleaching events. Using the extent of coral cover return to a pre-bleaching baseline as a benchmark, recovery of fast-growing and stress-tolerant coral growth forms suggests that reefs can bounce back between repeated disturbances if given adequate time and protection from anthropogenic disturbances. However, long-term recovery dynamics of coral communities following severe bleaching and mass mortality are limited, particularly for fringing reefs along inhabited coastlines where human stressors may compromise recovery potential.</description>

      <description>Ecological communities are reorganizing in response to warming temperatures. For continuous ocean habitats this reorganization is characterized by large‐scale species redistribution, but for tropical discontinuous habitats such as coral reefs, spatial isolation coupled with strong habitat dependence of fish species imply that turnover and local extinctions are more significant mechanisms. In these systems, transient marine heatwaves are causing coral bleaching and profoundly altering habitat structure, yet despite severe bleaching events becoming more frequent and projections indicating annual severe bleaching by the 2050s at most reefs, long‐term effects on the diversity and structure of fish assemblages remain unclear.</description>

      <description>Repeated bouts of coral bleaching threaten the long-term persistence of coral reefs and associated com- munities. Here, we document the short- and long-term impacts of heatwave events on coral and fish assemblages, based on regular surveys of 18 reefs of the granitic islands of Seychelles over 23 yr. Extreme heat events in 1998 and 2016 led to bleaching-associated declines in coral cover, whilst between these years there was an interim period of coral recovery on some reefs.</description>

      <title>Uncovering drivers of juvenile coral density following mass bleaching</title>

      <description>Thermally induced mass coral bleaching is globally responsible for major losses of coral cover. Coral recovery from mass coral disturbances like the 2016 bleaching event hinges on successful recruitment of new coral colonies to the existing population. Juvenile corals as a life history stage represent survival and growth of new recruits. As such, habitat preferences of juvenile corals and how environmental parameters interact to drive coral recovery following a mass bleaching disturbance are important research areas.</description>

      <title>Productive instability of coral reef fisheries after climate-driven regime shifts</title>

      <description>Tropical coastal communities are highly reliant on coral reefs, which provide nutrition and employment for millions of people. Climate-driven coral bleaching events are fundamentally changing coral reef ecosystems and are predicted to reduce produc- tivity of coral reef fish and fisheries, with significant implications for food security and livelihoods. Yet evidence of long-term bleaching impacts on coral reef fishery productivity is lacking. Here, we analyse over 20 years of fish abundance, catch and habitat data to assess long-term impacts of climate-driven coral mass mortality and regime shifts on nearshore artisanal coral reef fisheries in the Seychelles.</description>

      <title>Environmental conditions and herbivore biomass determine coral
reef benthic community composition: implications for quantitative

      <description>Our ability to understand natural constraints on coral reef benthic communities requires quantitative assessment of the relative strengths of abiotic and biotic processes across large spatial scales. Here, we combine underwater images, visual censuses and remote sensing data for 1,566 sites across 34 islands spanning the central- western Pacific Ocean, to empirically assess the relative roles of abiotic and grazing processes in determining the prevalence of calcifying organisms and fleshy algae on coral reefs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Climate Change Research With Open Science</title>

      <description>Climate change research aims to understand global environmental change and how it will impact nature and society. The broad scope of climate change impacts means that successful adaptation and mitigation efforts will require an unprecedented collaboration effort that unites diverse disciplines and is able to rapidly respond to evolving climate issues (IPCC, 2014). However, to achieve this aim, climate change research practices need updating: key research findings remain behind journal paywalls, and scientific progress can be impeded by low levels of reproducibility and transparency (Ellison, 2010; Morueta-Holme et al.</description>

      <title>Fishing degrades size structure of coral reef fish communities</title>

      <description>Fishing pressure on coral reef ecosystems has been frequently linked to reductions of large fishes and reef fish biomass. Associated impacts on overall community structure are, however, less clear. In size-structured aquatic ecosystems, fishing impacts are commonly quantified using size spectra, which describe the distribution of individual body sizes within a community. We examined the size spectra and biomass of coral reef fish communities at 38 US- affiliated Pacific islands that ranged in human presence from near pristine to human population centers.</description>

      <title>Testing and recommending methods for fitting size spectra to data</title>

      <description>The size spectrum of an ecological community characterizes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size. Size spectra are often used as ecosystem indicators of marine systems. They have been fitted to data from various sources, including groundfish trawl surveys, visual surveys of fish in kelp forests and coral reefs, sediment samples of benthic invertebrates and satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll.
 Over the past decades, several methods have been used to fit size spectra to data.</description>

      <title>Trophic roles determine coral reef fish community size structure</title>

      <description>Relationships between abundance – body size and trophic position – body size can reveal size structuring in food webs and test ecological theory. Although there is considerable evidence of size structuring in temperate aquatic food webs, little is known about the structure of tropical coral reef food webs. Here, we use underwater visual-census data and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to test if coral reef fish communities (i) are size structured and (ii) follow metabolic scaling rules.</description>

      <title>Estimation of predator-prey mass ratios using stable isotopes:
sources of errors</title>

      <description>In aquatic systems, the ratio of predator mass to prey mass (PPMR) is an important constraint on food web structure, and has been correlated with environmental stability. One common approach of estimating PPMR uses nitrogen stable isotopes (δ15N) as an indicator of trophic position, under the assumption that the discrimination between diet and tissue is constant with increasing diet δ15N (an additive approach). However, recent studies have shown that this assumption may not be valid and that there is a negative trend between the δ15N of the diet and the discrimination value (a scaled approach).</description>

      <title>The limitations of diversity metrics in directing global marine
conservation</title>

      <description>Biodiversity hotspots have been used extensively in setting conservation priorities for marine ecosystems. A recent Nature publication claims to have uncovered new latitudinal gradients in the evenness of reef communities and new reef hotspots based on functional diversity. Simulation models show that the purported evenness gradient is a mathematical inevitability of differences in species richness and detectability between vastly different marine ecosystems, namely ‘reefs’ in tropical, temperate, and polar regions. Constraints on evenness, along with disparity amongst communities in possible functional traits, cast doubt on the utility of global functional diversity comparisons for management of marine systems.</description>

      <title>Interspecific synchrony of seabird population growth rate and
breeding success</title>

      <description>Environmental variability can destabilize communities by causing correlated interspecific fluctuations that weaken the portfolio effect, yet evidence of such a mechanism is rare in natural systems. Here, we ask whether the population dynamics of similar sympatric species of a seabird breeding community are syn- chronized, and if these species have similar exceptional responses to environ- mental variation. We used a 24-year time series of the breeding success and population growth rate of a marine top predator species group to assess the degree of synchrony between species demography.</description>
